                <p><i>Interesting Facts about Cicada</i></p>
                <ul type="circle">
                    <li>The body of a cicada is similar to that of a violin or a guitar, in that much of it consists of empty, air-filled spaces that act like a resonating chamber and amplify the sound they generate</li>
                    <li>Scientists divide the over 3,000 cicada species into two groups: annual and periodical</li>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Annual cicadas emerge from the ground at different times each summer. These insects avoid predators by camouflaging themselves in the trees and flying from hungry birds and moles</li>
                            <li>They have black backs, orange bellies, and red eyes. Millions—or even billions!—of cicadas might come out all at once, so these bugs aren’t trying to hide</li>
                            <li>An annual cicada — the kind you see every year — can live two to five years</li>
                            <li>the periodical cicadas can live up to 17 years in the larva stage</li>
                        </ol>
                    <li>Cicadas live on all continents except Antarctica</li>
                    <li>They have an extended wrist bone that they use like a thumb to help them grip food</li>
                    <li>Pandas need at least 2 different bamboo species in their range to avoid starvation</li>
